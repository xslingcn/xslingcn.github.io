I'm a second-year undergraduate student at the **University of Washington, Seattle** in Computer Science. I'm working in [SAMPL](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Zihao Ye](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zhye/) and advised by [Dr. Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/). I currently hold a broad interest in machine learning systems, data-centric AI and natural language processing.
