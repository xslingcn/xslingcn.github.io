I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the **University of Washington, Seattle** in Computer Science. I'm an undergraduate researcher in [SAMPL](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/) working on building efficient machine learning systems, where I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Zihao Ye](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zhye/) and advised by [Prof. Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
